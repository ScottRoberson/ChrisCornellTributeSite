# ChrisCornellTributeSite
This site is a tribute to former Soundgarden front man Chris Cornell. In an attempt to work on html and CSS I attempted to replicate the site the best I could. While it may not be as intricate as the original I did use a few tricks and work arounds to get the job done. A hamburger menu was added for mobile sites starting at 768px (Ipad) and under.
