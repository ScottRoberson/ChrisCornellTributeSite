      <p class="article-body">
        A massive crowd gathered on a misty Sunday to honor the late grunge pioneer Chris Cornell. The Seattle Museum of
        Pop Culture unveiled a life-size bronze statue of the late Soundgarden singer, which was commissioned by his
        widow, Vicky Cornell. She was there with their children Lily, Toni and Christopher, as well as Cornell’s former
        bandmates Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd.

      <p class="article-body quote">
        “Soon after Chris passed away, I was inspired to make a care package for the last Soundgarden crew from the
        fateful April/May tour of 2017. With the help of Josh Graham and Chris Siglin,we created shirts, stickers and
        hoodies for our crew. Since March 2018, I have been wearing the “Chris stage shirt” I designed and fans have
        been
        loving it on social media. Josh Graham and I created a new version of my “Chris stage shirt” that I hope our
        fans
        will like as much as I do. Vicky Cornell and I have decided to make the shirt available to the public, with all
        proceeds going to our various charities. Wear it with pride. Thank you and Loudest of Love to you all.” – Matt
        Cameron
